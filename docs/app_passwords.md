The Tasks.org synchronization service is powered by the open CalDAV protocol,
which means it is compatible with third-party task and calendar apps! You must
generate a username and password to sign in to Tasks.org with apps like
Outlook, Thunderbird, or Apple Reminders.

These credentials grant complete access to the tasks and calendars in your
Tasks.org account. Generate as many passwords as you need, but do not write
them down or share them with anyone!

#### To generate an app password:

1. Open your account settings by tapping on `☰ > Settings > Tasks.org`
2. Tap on `Generate new password`
3. (Optional) Enter a description for this password, like 'Outlook on my
   laptop'
4. Tap `OK`
5. Enter the URL, username, and password into your third-party app before
   dismissing the dialog. _These credentials cannot be displayed after
   dismissing the dialog!_

#### To delete an app password:

1. Open your account settings by tapping on `☰ > Settings > Tasks.org`
2. Tap the trashcan icon next to the password you would like to delete
3. Tap 'OK' to confirm. Any apps that were configured with this password will
   no longer have access to Tasks.org
