You can schedule recurring tasks with Tasks.org.
In the edit screen of a task you can set the interval.

#### Handling overdue tasks
There are two ways of how to deal with overdue tasks:

##### Repeat from completion date
If a task is overdue and has been completed, schedule the next task starting from now.
For example if your task is to brush you teeth daily and you have missed a few times, then it doesn't make sense to brush your teeth for each day that you have missed.
With the "Repeat from completion date" Tasks will schedule the next instance from once that you got around doing it.

##### Repeat from Due date
If the task is overdue and you complete it, Tasks will only complete the specific instance, and schedule the next task starting at the time that the completed task was due.
For example if you need to hand in some tax report every month and you have missed a few months, you will still need to do this task for every single month that you have missed so far.
