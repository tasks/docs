## Recurring reminders

Use recurring reminders when you want a task to notify you repeatedly until it is completed.

Tap on `+` to create a new task, tap on `Add reminder`, then tap on `Custom...`. On the first screen
you will configure the initial reminder. For example, `0 minutes before due` will notify you at the due time.

Now tap on `Does not repeat`. On this screen you will configure the repeating reminder interval and the repeating
reminder limit. For example, `Repeats every 15 minutes, 4 times` will generate new notifications every 15 minutes
for one hour after the task is due.
