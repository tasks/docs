DecSync (Decentralized Synchronization) can be used to synchronize your tasks
without a server.

The DecSync CC app, [available from
F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.decsync.cc/), will synchronize your
tasks with iCalendar files on your device's internal storage.  You are
responsible for synchronizing the DecSync directory with other devices. One
solution is to use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)

Your DecSync lists will automatically appear in Tasks after setting up DecSync
CC
