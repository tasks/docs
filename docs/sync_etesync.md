[EteSync](https://www.etesync.com) is a secure, end-to-end encrypted,
and privacy respecting sync for your contacts, calendars and tasks. It's
fully open-source (clients and server), with clients available for
Android, iOS, the desktop and the web.

In order to use EteSync sync you need to have an account with EteSync (paid
hosting), or [run your own instance](https://github.com/etesync/server) (free
and open source).  Check out [the EteSync website](https://www.etesync.com/)
for more information.

### Setup

The [EteSync Android
client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.etesync.syncadapter)
can populate Tasks with data, or you can enter your credentials into Tasks and
synchronize directly with your EteSync host.

Once your account is signed-in, Tasks will create a Category with your username in the sidebar. Your etesync lists will be kept separately from your local lists. In order to upload your existing lists to etesync, you have to use multi-select + select all + move to migrate the data for each list. For more info, see: [issue #1597](https://github.com/tasks/tasks/issues/1597).
