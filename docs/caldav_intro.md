CalDAV [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV)] is an open Internet
standard for synchronizing calendar events and task lists.  Tasks can
synchronize with a variety of CalDAV servers. Set up a free or paid account
with a third party service, or host your own from a selection of open-source
servers

The following is not an exhaustive list of compatible services. If any services

### Adding an account

Select ```Tasks settings > Synchronization > Add account > CalDAV``` and enter
the following details:

* **User** for authentication with your CalDAV server
* **Password** for authentication with your CalDAV server
  * Android 6+: Passwords will be encrypted with the Android KeyStore
  * Android 4 and 5: Passwords will be stored in **plain text**
* **URL** to your CalDAV home set
  * Tasks will follow the ```/.well-known/caldav``` redirect for URLs that use
    SSL. As an example you can enter ```https://my.owndrive.com``` and Tasks
    will find your home set
  * For servers that do not provide a redirect you will need to enter the home
    set URL yourself. This URL will vary by server, but will look something
    like ```https://example.com/remote.php/caldav/calendars/myusername/```
* **Server type**
