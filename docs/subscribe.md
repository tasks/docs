Tasks is [free and open-source
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) that
does not display advertisements or sell your personal information. In order to
support development some features require a subscription

Google Play subscriptions come with a 7-day free trial. You can upgrade,
downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time

### Choose your own subscription price

Tasks offers the ability to choose your own subscription price. You can
unlock all in-app features for as little as $0.99 USD/year, however you will not
have access to the Tasks.org synchronization service

### Synchronization with Tasks.org

In order to synchronize your data with Tasks.org's synchronization service you must maintain one of the following:

* Google Play subscription for $2.99/month or $29.99/year
* [GitHub sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/abaker) for $3/month

### One-time purchases

I know you hate subscriptions. I don't like them either.

Mobile apps must be maintained and supported forever, and one-time purchases
are not an effective method of funding development¹. When one-time sales dry up
then developers abandon the app. Subscriptions give them an incentive to
keep you happy.

Tasks does not offer a one-time purchase option, however there is a "hack" to
unlock the app for many years:

1. Tap on `☰ > Help & feedback`
2. Tap on `Upgrade to pro > More options`, and choose a price. Every $1 will
   unlock the app for approximately one year, i.e. $4.99 ≈ 5 years, $9.99 ≈ 10
   years, $24.99 ≈ 25 years
   * **Note:** You must wait until your trial period ends and your account is
     charged before continuing with step 3
3. Tap on `Modify subscription > More options` and choose `$0.99/year`. Google
   will apply your existing balance towards the new subscription. The Google
   Play purchase pop-up will confirm your new expiration date
4. Feel free to cancel your new subscription so that it does not auto-renew

¹ I'm making a broad generalization, but my Play Store purchase history is
littered with one-time purchases that were abandoned by their developers years
ago

### F-Droid

F-Droid users do not require a subscription to unlock all in-app features.
[Donations](donate.md) are highly appreciated!

F-Droid users who wish to synchronize their data with Tasks.org's
synchronization service require a GitHub sponsorship or Google Play
subscription.
