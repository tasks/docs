title: New Privacy Policy, Same Old Privacy

You may have noticed the shiny new [privacy policy](/privacy). Don't panic!
Nothing has actually changed about how Tasks handles your data.

<!-- truncate -->

The old privacy policy was, shall we say, *charmingly handcrafted*, and it was
time for something a little more official-looking. Think of it as Tasks putting
on a nice blazer for a job interview - same person underneath, just slightly more
presentable to lawyers.

**What's different?** The words on the page.

**What's the same?** Everything that actually matters:

* I only collect personal information if you use the Tasks.org sync service
* I don't sell your data to anyone

This update is purely for legal housekeeping. The new policy was generated by
[Termly.io](https://termly.io) based on Tasks.org's existing feature set, so
that if anyone ever asks "hey, do you have a real privacy policy?" I can
confidently say yes, without crossing my fingers behind my back.
