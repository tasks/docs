title: Tasks Gets a Terms of Service

Similar to the [new privacy policy](/blog/privacy-policy-update), Tasks now has an
official [terms of service](/terms). Starting with version 14.9, Google Play users
will be asked to agree to it when opening the app.

:::note[Note for F-Droid Users]
If you downloaded Tasks from F-Droid, these terms do not apply to you unless you
sign in to a Tasks.org account for synchronization. Your use of the app
remains governed solely by the [open source license (GPLv3)](https://tasks.org/license).
:::

<!-- truncate -->

The [open source license](https://tasks.org/license) already covers the basics, but a proper terms
of service fills in the gaps.

Like the privacy policy, the terms of service was generated by
[Termly.io](https://termly.io) based on Tasks.org's existing feature set. It
covers the standard stuff you'd expect:

* Acceptable use (don't do crimes with the app, please)
* Liability limits (I'm one person and I don't want to lose my house)
* The usual legal boilerplate that keeps lawyers happy

**The terms do not reflect any change in functionality or behavior.** Tasks.org
works exactly the same as it did yesterday.

### Regarding "Expansive" Language

Because these terms are generated from standard commercial templates, you might
see broad boilerplate language (such as restrictions on "reverse engineering" or
competition) that feels out of place for a free software project.

I have manually added a "Supremacy Clause" to the Terms of Service.
This explicitly states that the GPLv3 license takes priority. Your rights to
study, modify, and distribute the Tasks.org source code remain absolute and
unaffected.
